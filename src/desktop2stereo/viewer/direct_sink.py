"""Registry connecting the packer thread to the Vulkan viewer's staging.

The native macOS path keeps capture, Core ML preprocessing/inference, depth
sanitization, and warp packing on the GPU. MoltenVK does not expose its
mapped transfer allocation as a valid Metal ``MTLBuffer`` on this host, so
the bridge records one explicit GPU-warp-to-Vulkan mapped-buffer handoff
copy. The viewer still submits ``CopyBufferToImage`` from the claimed ring
slot without a CPU color conversion or NumPy packing fallback.

Hand-off safety: a source is "pending" from the moment the packer takes
it until the viewer's fence confirms the GPU finished reading it (the
next present's ``vkWaitForFences``). While pending, ``acquire`` returns
None and the packer falls back to the IOSurface stage + memcpy path, so
a slow viewer can never race a warp write.
